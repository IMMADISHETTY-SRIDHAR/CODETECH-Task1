Overview of Project Task:

The Python program is about a simple calculator that allows a user to perform basic arithmetic operations. Here's a brief overview of its components and functionality:

Key Components:
1. *Four Functions for Arithmetic Operations:*
   1 add(x, y): Returns the sum of x and y.
   2 subtract(x, y): Returns the difference between x and y.
   3 multiply(x, y): Returns the product of x and y.
   4 divide(x, y): Returns the quotient of x and y. It also checks if the denominator (y) is zero, in which case it returns an error message to avoid division by zero.

2. *User Input:*
   1 The user is prompted to enter two numbers (num1 and num2).
   2 The user is then asked to choose an operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division by selecting 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. *Conditional Logic:*
   1 Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding operation.
   2 If the user enters an invalid choice (i.e., not 1-4), the program will notify them that the input is invalid.

4. *Error Handling:*
   1 The program checks for *division by zero* when performing division, returning an appropriate error message if attempted.

Flow of Execution:
1. The program starts by welcoming the user.
2. The user inputs two numbers.
3. The user chooses an operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, etc.).
4. The calculator performs the selected operation and displays the result.
5. If division by zero is attempted, the program displays an error message.

Features:
1 *Modular Design:* The calculator uses separate functions for each operation, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
2 *Input Handling:* Ensures that invalid operations (like dividing by zero) are caught and handled gracefully.
3 *User-friendly Interface:* Clear prompts and error messages ensure that the user can easily interact with the calculator.

This simple calculator is a great starting point for basic Python programming, helping users understand functions, user input, conditional statements, and error handling.
